# Security-Management-System
A citizen report and complaint management system featuring a mobile app for submitting crime, violence, and assault reports, and a desktop app for administrators to receive, manage, and resolve them. Deployed in Taiz City, the systemâ€™s user interfaces were built with Flutter, while the backend server was developed using ASP.NET.

The system consists of three applications: a mobile application that citizens can use to submit their reports at any time, a security management application that receives and manages reports and verifies their authenticity, and an application for the concerned authorities to address the issues and provide assistance to citizens.
The Security Report Management System contributes to improving the enforcement of law and order by automating the current system's functions, reducing human effort, pressure, and errors. The system plays a major role in reducing crimes and violations, encouraging individuals to comply with the law, and providing services to citizens that enhance security and reliability in protecting and 
safeguarding the community.
The system features several advanced mechanisms such as a mechanism to prevent false reports by verifying the authenticity of reports and scrutinizing the incoming information, and using the latest technologies to ensure security and reliability. 
The system relies on strong and modern technologies to ensure data confidentiality and protection from unauthorized access. Additionally, the system contributes to providing accurate statistics and analyses that assist security authorities in making informed and swift 
decisions.Through this system, communication between citizens and security authorities has been improved, leading to increased trust and cooperation between citizens and authorities. 
The system allows citizens to submit reports easily and quickly, track the status of reports, and receive timely responses and notifications. It also provides security authorities with a powerful tool to manage reports, analyze data, and take necessary actions promptly and efficiently.
